要有
header:
navigation bar:
main content:
sidebar:
footer:

为了视障人群，在你的HTML代码里，you can mark up sections of content based on their _functionality_

- **header**:`<header>`.
- **navigation bar**:`<nav>`.
- **main content**:`<main>`,with various content subsevtions represented by `<article>`,`<section>`,and`<div>`elements.
- **sidebar**:`<aside>`;often placed inside`<main>`.
- **footer**:`<footer>`.

`<main>`
`<article>`
`<section>`可有很多在article里
`<aside>`
`<header>`可以是`<article>`或者`<section>`的specific header
`<nav>`
`<footer>`

## Non-semantic wrappers
有时候你需要一些东西来把一系列元素包在一起来共同应用CSS或者JavaScript，或者一些content。所以有`<div>`和`<span>`，和class属性。

`<span>`is an inline non-semantic element.
```
<p>
  The King walked drunkenly back to his room at 01:00, the beer doing nothing to
  aid him as he staggered through the door.
  <span class="editor-note">
    [Editor's note: At this point in the play, the lights should be down low].
  </span>
</p>
```
`<div>`is a block level non-semantic element.
```
<div class="shopping-cart">
  <h2>Shopping cart</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href=""><strong>Silver earrings</strong></a>: $99.95.
      </p>
      <img src="../products/3333-0985/thumb.png" alt="Silver earrings" />
    </li>
    <li>…</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Total cost: $237.89</p>
</div>
```
这不是`<aside>`因为不是必须与网页的主文本有联系，甚至不能特别正当的使用`<section>`，因为不是主要文本的一部分。

**Warning:** Divs are so convenient to use that it's easy to use them too much. As they carry no semantic value, they just clutter your HTML code. Take care to use them only when there is no better semantic solution and try to reduce their usage to the minimum otherwise you'll have a hard time updating and maintaining your documents.

## Line breaks and horizontal rules
`<br />`line break
`<hr>`thematic break主题 **Horizontal Rule**
会创造一条水平线，horizontal rule
```

  There once was a man named O'Dell<br />
  Who loved to write HTML<br />
  But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br />
  and his markup didn't read very well.
</p>
```

```
<p>
  Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, but
  determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and prepared to do
  battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and
  pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted
  distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it
  hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.
